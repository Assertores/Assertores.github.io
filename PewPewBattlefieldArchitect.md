## My Work

I worked as Lead Programmer and Vision Keeper. So I was responsible for all the documentation together with my producer. I also took on the role of Network Programmer and implemented the Network backbone ontop of the UDP Standard.
I was responcable for the Tick and Gamestate implimentation as it is very strongly tight to the Netcode. In addition to that I tryed to help my two Programming colleagues as good as I could to enshure fast development.
