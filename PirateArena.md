## Vision Statement

A local 1on1 Pirate Seafight Game.

## Project

This game emerged from an internal Game Jam at Games Academy. The Theme of the Jam was "Fire" and we interpreted it as the command a captain shouts to _fire_ at the enemy. At the end of the Game Jam one of the team members decided to use the game as foundation for his semester project [Neoflux-Drift](https://www.facebook.com/Neoflux-Drift-413204549232415/), which in turn was carried over to the next semester project, aiming for a commercial release.

## My Work

My part was working as a programmer on the initial Game Jam project: Pirate Arena.
