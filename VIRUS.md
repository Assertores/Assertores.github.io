## Vision Statement

V.I.R.U.S is an isometric 3D stealth puzzler in which the player is a virus and tries to infiltrate a system. For this he uses different skills to trick security systems.

## Project

the game started out as a much more complex stealth game in which you explore nonlinear levels with a huge tool set at your disposal, to trick the guards. in the middle of the semester, we noticed that the game isn't fun or interesting to play. so we scratch most of the design and greatly reduced the player abilitys. we also changed from big nonlinear levels to tight, short, linear tutorial levels, of whitch we made 8 to shocase every single player ability in isolation. the game now continues to be developt for a comertial release on Smartphones.

## My Work

as game designer, i was tasked to design and document all mechanics, design the Levels on paper and in Engine, and balance all the playerabilitys and enemies to created a thrilling experience, that leaves you sitting at the edge of your chair. i also was tasked together with my producer to cut down the mecanics to make the game interesting again. alfter the semester ended i was asked if i want to continue working on it in a professional envirement but i delined it in faver of pursuing my studys at Games Academy.
