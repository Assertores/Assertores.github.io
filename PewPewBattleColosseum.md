## Vision Statement

Pew Pew Battle Colosseum is a funny 2D PvP Shooter in a distinct comic book style arena. Use the recoil of your weapon to navigate through a low gravity environment and shoot your opponents down.

## Project

the game was made by one Game designer, one Programmer, one Producer and four Digital Artists. because the scope of the game was that small, we were able to focus on polishing and protecting the game and start with playtests vary early on. we exibited the game at [Animesse](https://www.animemesse.de/), an presentation of external stakeholders, [IFA](https://www.ifa-berlin.com/de/), [Deutscher Multimediapreis mb21](https://www.mb21.de/), [Next Level festival](https://www.next-level.org/) and twice on [Talk and Play](https://berlingamescene.com/talkandplay/) (ones at the beginning and ones at the end of the project time). we also submitted our game to the [Creative Gaming Award 2019](https://playfestival.de/play19/category/award/) ,[Deutscher Multimediapreis 2019](https://www.mb21.de/) and [Deutscher Entwicklerpreis 2019](https://www.deutscherentwicklerpreis.de/macht-mit-beim-ubisoft-blue-byte-newcomer-award-studierende/) (Categorie: Ubisoft Newcomer Award). due to the high degree of polish we where able to get 100 points on the rating from the jury at the goldmaster.

## My Work

i made the initial idea for the game as i watch the video [The art of screenshake](https://youtu.be/AJdEqssNZ-U?t=1029). after i talkt about it with my potential future team, i imediatly started working on a prototype at the vacation. as the mechanic is very simple and i gathert some experience from my previous two semesters, I was able to present a playable prototype at open call. after that i gratualy moved away from gamedesign and towords programming, as my programming partner did the exagt opposit and tock over the Lead Game Design role. therefore it's fair to say that i was the only proggrammer on the team.
